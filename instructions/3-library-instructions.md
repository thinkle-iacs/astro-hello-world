# Adding a Library: Installing Your First Library

[Back to Overview](../README.md) | [Next: Finding more libraries](./4-more-libraries.md)

Enhance your website by adding third-party libraries. Let's start by installing a simple style library called **PicoCSS** and an animate-on-scroll library called AOS (Animate-On-Scroll).

**PicoCSS** will automatically handle some basic
formatting for you and make it easy to have a clean, modern looking website without taking a whole web design class.

**AOS.js** is an example of a simple JavaScript library enhancement -- in this case, it makes it easy to make items fade in or animate in some way when
they first scroll onto the screen.

## Installing PicoCSS

### Step 1: Install PicoCSS via npm

To install new libraries, you'll need to run the `npm` command from a `terminal`. This is a
text-based user interface that has existed in computing since well before the typical
graphical interfaces we know today, but it is still used by programmers frequently.

To open a terminal in Github Codespaces, you'll find the "Terminal" tab next to where
you've opened "Ports" before at the bottom of the screen. If you're already running your
project, you'll need to open a new terminal by clicking on the "+" icon which will open
up a command promps where you can type your command.
Typically the prompt will end with a `$`.

Then, type this command:

```sh
npm install @picocss/pico
```

### Step 2: Import PicoCSS Globally

Open your `main.js` file located in the `scripts` directory and add the following import statement:

```js
import "@picocss/pico/css/pico.min.css";
```

### Step 3: Use PicoCSS in Your HTML

You can now use PicoCSS classes in the HTML in your .astro files. For example, to center your content and set a reasonable width, you can add the following:

```html
<main class="container">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</main>
```

You can also take a look at the PicoCSS documentation to see how to make tooltips, dropdown menus, and other basic UI elements.

# Adding a Library: Installing Your First Library

Now let's install **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**, which adds animations to elements as they scroll into view. This library requires both a CSS import and a small JavaScript call to initialize.

## Installing AOS

### Step 1: Install AOS via npm

Run the following command in your project directory at the terminal:

```sh
npm install aos
```

### Step 2: Modify `main.js`

Open your `main.js` file in the `scripts` directory and modify it as follows.

(1) Underneath the comment `//Add imports here` add the imports
for the CSS and JS needed for AOS.

```js
import Aos from "aos";
import "aos/dist/aos.css";
```

(2) Underneath the comment `// Code that runs ONLY in the browser` add:
console.log("Hello world, from main.js!");

```js
Aos.init();
```

### Step 3: Use AOS in Your HTML

Now, you can add AOS to any HTML element by using the `data-aos` attribute.

For example, to make a heading fade in as it scrolls into view:

```html
<h1 data-aos="fade-in">Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
```

### Step 4: Customize Animation Settings (Optional)

You can also customize the animation duration and delay by adding extra attributes:

```html
<h1 data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-duration="1500" data-aos-delay="300">
  Welcome to My Portfolio!
</h1>
```

This example will make the heading fade in over 1.5 seconds with a 300ms delay.

Now your project is set up to use **AOS** for scroll-triggered animations! Youâ€™ve imported the required CSS and initialized the library using the `main.js` file with a conditional check to ensure it runs only in the browser.
